Assignment #1: Mini-Search Game

There are total of 4 separate methods (other than main): isAdmin, adminGrid, makeGrid, findString.

isAdmin method takes in a string and checks to see if a user inputs "A" to indicate if they're an admin. If not, it would simply return false
adminGrid method takes in the grid, row, and col to print out the grid for the admin. There has been space created between each letter in same row to increase readability.
makeGrid methods takes in an array of letters, row, and col to create a grid of letters, returning multi-dimensional array.
findString takes in the grid as well as row and col to zig-zag through the grid, bouncing off if necessary. When it reaches the end, the method returns the solution string.
