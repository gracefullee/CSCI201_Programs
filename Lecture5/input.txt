C++: ifstream, ofstream
C: functions such as printf and scanf

If you need to use Scanner class in another function other than main,
	Either close the first Scanner variable
	OR pass it in as a variable in your new function
	
Exception Handling
	Use Conditional Statements if possible! (Faster runtime than Exception Handling)
	Checked exception
		Code will not compile unless you handle the exception
	Unchecked exception
	Errors We Can't Handle
		NoClassDefFoundError: Class existed when compiled (which created .class file), probably deleted between compiling and running, but is missing at runtime
		OutOfMemoryError: Computer is out of memory; is going to crash
	Exceptions that Can be Handled
Catch ALL - catch (Exception e) { } - BUT ONLY PRINTS "EXCEPTION OCCURRED" does not inform you about what type of exception occurred
Finally { } - executes whether there was an exception or not (as long as it's handled)

PrintWriter overwrites over existing files with same name by default
PrintWriter.flush() - writes back to the hard drive
